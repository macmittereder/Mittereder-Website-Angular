        <h3>Created senior year of high school for iOS developed in xCode. The idea of this app was broughtto me by a classmate and we became partners to develop it. I was responsible for
            the programming part of the project and he did the visual aspect of it using vector art.
            Before release of the app we strategically advertised it with social media to build up the popularity.
            After the release of FrameIt the app was placed on the top paid photography app list and
            made it on the list of overall top paid apps.</h3>
