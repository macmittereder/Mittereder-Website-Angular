        <h3>This app was developed junior year of high school for Android using eclipse. Theidea of this app was a proof of concept to develop my first app and publish
            it on the play store. During a java class we developed a rock, paper, scissors
            game with command line style input so I ported it to be more interactive
            in an app setting.</h3>
