        <h3>This app was developed sophomore year in college for a Software Engineer class forAndroid using Android Studio. I was the software lead on this project with
            5 other classmates working on this project. The goal of this app was a game
            thought up by a math department teacher to move "pebbles" around a map that
            was created using graph theory to the end node to win the game. The game was
            developed to be a two player game but an AI element was developed in my free
            time to create a single player mode.</h3>
