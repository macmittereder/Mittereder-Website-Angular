        <h3>This app was developed for my capstone project for Saint Vincent College using Android Studio and Firebase. Gradez allows users to track their grades for classes that are accumulative or weighted. Firebase is used to manage users and for a database. Below is a representation of my capstone

                    <p class="black">Students often have trouble keeping track of grades and some teachers don’t use the tools provided to post grades onlinefor the students to view. Gradez is a mobile application developed for the Android platform to solve this dilemma. This
                        application calculates class grades that are either accumulative points or in weighted categories. All data and user accounts
                        are stored in a cloud database called Firebase allowing users to be logged into as many devices as they want with uniform data
                        across them. When grades are added to the user’s account the data will refresh on any other devices so that the data can be kept
                        synchronous. This Android application is available for free on the Google Play store and gives students an easy solution to keep
                        track of their grades.</p>

                        retained. Real time updates assist this app when users have multiple devices concurrently running it. When any data is added, edited,
                        or deleted on one device, the other devices will refresh showing the changes as to keep all devices synced. Redundancy of data is vital
                        in today’s society when users could lose, damage, or replace their device. When any of these circumstances occur the user will retain
                        their data.
